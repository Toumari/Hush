2. **Active mix** — 3 sounds active (Rain + Brown Noise + Wind), mixer panel expanded with volume sliders visible.
3. **Sleep timer** — Timer dialog open with "1 hour" selected.

Tips:
- Use a Pixel 7 or similar emulator for clean bezels
- Take screenshots with status bar showing full battery and clean time (e.g. 10:30)
- Dark UI screenshots look best with a slight drop shadow on the Play Store's white background
